NET CLI development.
In this development, I developed a usage option that packs into one file a folder with files,
for example a c# file containing a bin and obj folder and I don't need the user to be forced to open a folder and inside there will be several more folders,
this is not aesthetic, so I pack everything into one file with the extension cs and the user will only run this file
